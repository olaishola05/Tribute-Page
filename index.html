                        <h3>Birth</h3>
                        <p> Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata,
                                then part of South Africa's Cape Province. Given the forename Rolihlahla,
                                a Xhosa term colloquially meaning <strong>"troublemaker"</strong>, in later
                                years he became known by his clan name, Madiba.
                                His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king of the Thembu people
                                in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province.
                                One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the
                                source of his surname. Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of the
                                Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his cadet branch
                                of the royal family were morganatic,
                                ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal
                                councillors.

                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <p>In 1934 he began his secondary education at <em>Clackebury Methodist High School</em>
                                in Engcobo, a western-style instituition that was the largest school for black
                                africans in Thembuland.
                                He completed his junior Certificate in two years and in 1937 moved to
                                Healthtown, the Methodist college in Forte Beaufort attended by Thembu royalty,
                                including justice.
                                During his time at the college he spent much of his spare time as a
                                long-distance runner and boxer, and in his second year he became a prefect.

                                In 1939 Mandela began to work on a BA degree at the University of Fort Hare, an
                                elite black institution
                                in Alice Easter Cape, There he studied English, anthropology, politics, native
                                administration and roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring to become an
                                interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department.
                                Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory, befriending his own kinsman, K.
                                D. Matanzima, as well as Oliver Tambo, who became a close friend and comrade
                                for decades to come. He took up ballroom dancing,
                                performed in a drama society play about <strong> Abraham Lincoln</strong>, and
                                gave Bible classes in the local community as part of the Student Christian
                                Association.
                                He helped to found a first-year students' house committee which challenged the
                                dominance of the second-years, and at the end of his first year became involved
                                in a Students' Representative Council (SRC) boycott against the quality of
                                food,
                                for which he was suspended from the university; he never returned to complete
                                his degree.
                                <br>
                                To continue his higher education, Mandela signed up to a University of South
                                Africa correspondence course,
                                working on his bachelor's degree at night and Passed his BA exams in early 1943
                                which then later moved on to follow political path rather than privy councillor
                                in Thembuland.
                                Between 1943 -1949
                                Mandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand as the only
                                black African student.
                                During his time at the university he became increasinly politicised</p>
