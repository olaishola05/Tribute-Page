                                <dd> Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata,
                                        then part of South Africa's Cape Province. Given the forename Rolihlahla,
                                        a Xhosa term colloquially meaning <strong>"troublemaker"</strong>, in later
                                        years he became known by his clan name, Madiba.
                                        His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king of the Thembu people
                                        in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province.
                                        One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the
                                        source of his surname. Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of the
                                        Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his cadet branch
                                        of the royal family were morganatic,
                                        ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal
                                        councillors.

                                <dd>In 1934 he began his secondary education at <em>Clackebury Methodist High School</em>
                                        in Engcobo, a western-style instituition that was the largest school for black
                                        africans in Thembuland.
                                        He completed his junior Certificate in two years and in 1937 moved to
                                        Healthtown, the Methodist college in Forte Beaufort attended by Thembu royalty,
                                        including justice.

                                        In 1939 Mandela began to work on a BA degree at the University of Fort Hare, an
                                        elite black institution
                                        in Alice Easter Cape, There he studied English, anthropology, politics, native
                                        administration and roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring to become an
                                        interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department.
                                        Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory, befriending his own kinsman, K.
                                        D. Matanzima, as well as Oliver Tambo, who became a close friend and comrade
                                        for decades to come. He took up ballroom dancing,
                                        performed in a drama society play about <strong> Abraham Lincoln</strong>, and
                                        gave Bible classes in the local community as part of the Student Christian
                                        Association. Suspended from the university for forming a committee to challenge
                                        the second year dominance; he never returned to complete
                                        his degree. To continue his higher education, Mandela signed up to a University
                                        of South
                                        Africa correspondence course,
                                        working on his bachelor's degree at night and Passed his BA exams in early 1943
                                        which then later moved on to follow political path rather than privy councillor
                                        in Thembuland.
                                        Between 1943 -1949
                                        Mandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand as the only
                                        black African student.

                                        After taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the forced relocation
                                        of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg in February
                                        1955, Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end
                                        apartheid and white minority rule.
                                        In December 1956, Mandela was arrested alongside most of the ANC national
                                        executive, and accused of "high treason" against the state and was held in
                                        Johannesburg prison.

                                        On 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil
                                        Williams near Howick.
                                        Jailed in Johannesburg's Marshall Square prison, Mandela was charged with
                                        inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country without permission.
                                        His hearing began in October, but he disrupted proceedings by wearing a
                                        traditional kaross, refusing to call any witnesses, and turning his plea of
                                        mitigation into a political speech. Found guilty, he was sentenced to five
                                        years' imprisonment. In 1964–1982 Mandela and his co-accused were transferred
                                        from Pretoria to the prison on
                                        Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years. Isolated from
                                        non-political prisoners in Section B, Mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete
                                        cell measuring 8 feet (2.4 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m), with a straw mat on which to
                                        sleep.

                                        In April 1982, Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town,
                                        along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada,
                                        and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their
                                        influence on younger activists at Robben Island.

                                        The newly elected National Assembly's first act was to formally elect Mandela
                                        as South Africa's first black chief
                                        executive. His inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994, televised to
                                        a billion viewers globally. The event
                                        was attended by four thousand guests, including world leaders from a wide range
                                        of geographic and ideological
                                        backgrounds.

                                        Retiring in June 1999, Mandela aimed to lead a quiet family life, divided
                                        between Johannesburg and Qunu.
                                        Mandela found such seclusion difficult and reverted to a busy public life
                                        involving daily programme of tasks, meetings with world leaders and
                                        celebrities, and—when in Johannesburg—working with the Nelson Mandela
                                        Foundation.
                                        In 2002, Mandela inaugurated the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, and in 2003 the
                                        Mandela Rhodes Foundation was created at Rhodes House, University of Oxford, to
                                        provide postgraduate scholarships to African students. These projects were
                                        followed by the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory and the 46664 campaign against
                                        HIV/AIDS.

                                        In June 2004, aged 85 and amid failing health, Mandela announced that he was
                                        "retiring from retirement" and retreating from public life, remarking, "Don't
                                        call me, I will call you."

                                        In February 2011, Mandela was briefly hospitalised with a respiratory
                                        infection, attracting international attention,before being
                                        re-admitted for a lung infection and gallstone removal in December
                                        2012. After a successful medical procedure in early March 2013,
                                        his lung infection recurred and he was briefly hospitalised in Pretoria.
                                        In June 2013, his lung infection worsened and he was readmitted to a Pretoria
                                        hospital in serious condition, later was discharged in September with condition remained 
                                        unstabled and died on 5 December 2013 at the age of 95.
